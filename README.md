# Ocean

A compiled programming language i make cause languages are fun.

## I want: 

1. Reference counting for garbage collection.
2. Ruby like syntax since ruby is sexy.
3. And very cool runtime like go has.

## Build:

Since i am loyal to my own work i decided to use my own build system 
[Chain](https://github.com/Eskpil/chain). Once you have it installed all
you have to do is chain run ./project.yml. Magic should happen and you
shall be graced with a build directory named bld.
